# Predicting Bat Coronavirus Positivity (w/ Machine Learning)

## Abstract

About 20% of the approximately 5,000 species of mammals are bats (order Chiroptera [meaning “hand wing”]). Among mammals, bats are unique in their ability to fly, and are found on all continents except Antarctica. The ability of bats to fly allows for efficient virus spread, and viral transmission from bats has been suspected in a number of major emerging infectious disease outbreaks. These include outbreaks of the SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) virus, MERS (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome) virus, Ebola virus, Nipah virus, and others. We planned to build machine learning model to predict how likely a bat species can serve as reservoir host of coronavirus.

## Background

- Bats comprise ~20% of mammal species (> 1,400 species)
- Serve as reservoir hosts of many deadly viruses (e.g. Ebola, Hendra, Nipah, SARS-type coronaviruses)
- Scientists do research on bats worldwide to study relationships between bats and viruses
- The SARS-CoV-2 virus that led to the COVID-19 pandemic most likely originated from an Asian bat species
